As mentioned before, there is a wide variety of cubical type theories to
choose from. They differ in nontrivial ways, but they are all equally
expressive. Throughout the mathematical material of this book, we will
use \cite{CCHM:2016}, or, more specifically, the variant of that theory
implemented in Agda, as described by \cite{Vezzosi:2019}.

This choice is \emph{premathematical}, so that it would be disingenuous
not to present the other choices. Therefore, after introducing the basic
practice of mathematics in CCHM, we will step back and travel to the
histories-that-were-not: how our basic definitions would have to change
to accomodate the change in type theory.
